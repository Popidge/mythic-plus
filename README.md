# Mythic Plus Score Calculator for World of Warcraft

This is a simple app that takes data on your Mythic+ runs from Raider.io and calculates how much rating you will gain from timing a certain key

The calculator is built in Javascript, pulling data from the Raider.io API and uses the same calculations as the WoW UI to predict gains

The character pages are built dynamically using the Astro ðŸš€ Framework, with basic styling using Tailwind

It'll be deployed and hosted on Netlify
